## Lapis Papyrus Scalpellus
This small project was the prework for joining General Assembly online cohort for Software Engineering Immersive. This project utilized basic css to create a layout of the game. The buttons call javascript functions once clicked.

### The game rules are:
- Lapis beats Scalpellus
- Papyrus beats Lapis
- Scalpellus beats Papyrus

Button click calls a javascript function to pick a choice for the player. Choice for the computer was already picked at random on button click. Then compare answers of the player and computer. If its a tie, print "It's a tie!" and include the choices of player and computer. If player wins, pring "Player Wins!" along with the choice of the two. Same process if computer wins.
